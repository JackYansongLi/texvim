# Vim-like text editing in TeXmacs

This is my attempt to add vim keybindings to TeXmacs. Everything here is very 
much WIP.

## Install
Install via
```bash
cd ~/.TeXmacs/plugins && git clone https://github.com/JackYansongLi/texvim.git
```

## Usage
Vim keybindings are deactivated automatically. They can be activated by pressing $\texttt{j k}$.
